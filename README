DESCRIPTION
These are some samples of my work with jQuery.
These include the following:
  -Scripts, includes some useful utilities I have created,
  as well as some site-specific page initialization scripts.
  -Nodalizer, a work-in-progress plugin that organizes DOM elements
  into a hierachical structure of parent and child elements or "nodes".
  Clicking on a parent node causes its children to toggle visibility:
    -Clicking a "closed" parent will show its immediate children
    -Clicking an "opened" parent will hide all of its descendants.

That's it!  Enjoy and contact me for any questions.
